## Overview

wgpt is a command-line tool that uses the power of the GPT-3.5 without needing API key. It uses `theb.ai` Free API to generate response. It has few flags to increase productivity. i.e. `-h flag` : It allows to repharase and copy to clipboard the response generated by ai .

## Usage

To use WGPT, you need Node.js installed on your machine. You can install the app globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g wgpt
```

After installation, you can run the app with the desired flags and prompt text:

```bash
wgpt "How to create a new file in Python?"
```

The app will process your input and generate a relevant response based on the provided flags.

## API and Backend

WGPT utilizes the GPT-3.5 language model developed by OpenAI. The app communicates with the Free API provided by `theb.ai` to send your input and receive the generated responses.

## Features

- **Rephrasing**: Add the `-h` flag to have "Rephrase this sentence in 3 different ways" prefixed to your input. This will prompt the app to provide you with three unique paraphrased versions of your original sentence.

- **Code Generation**: With the `-c` flag, the app will add "Write code for" to the start of your input. This will prompt the app to generate code based on your input, saving you time and effort when working on various programming tasks.

- **Clipboard Copy**: Optionally, you can use the `--no-clipboard` flag to prevent the app from automatically copying the response to your system clipboard.

## Examples

- To paraphrase a sentence:

  ```bash
  wgpt -h "Python is a versatile programming language."
  ```

- To generate code for a task:

  ```bash
  wgpt -c "Sort an array of numbers in ascending order using JavaScript."
  ```

- To turn off clipboard copying:
  ```bash
  wgpt --no-clipboard "What is the capital of France?"
  ```
